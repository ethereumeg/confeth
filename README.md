# confeth 🎉

**confeth** is a free and open-source conference/hackathon planning and managing tool with a focus on cryptocurrency-related events.

Its design is based on the popular planning tool [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/). We want to build a tool that is more compact, modern and minimalistic but contains most of the functionality needed to organize such an event. It is optimized for the cryptocurrency segment of open conferences and hackathons, such as those hosted by the [Ethereum community](https://ethereum.org/en/community/events/).

This project was created within the Czech-Slovak Ethereum community Gwei.cz for our own need to organize events such as [ETHBrno](http://ethbrno.cz/) hackathon or [UTXO Prague](https://utxo.cz/) conference. We will be happy if you use our tool or contribute!

## Key features
- All-in-one solution for hackathons or conferences
- Accountless (passwordless) attendee/proposal submission
- Simple and minimalistic UI
- [Pretix](https://pretix.eu/) ticketing integration
- SIWE (Sign-in with Ethereum) integration
- Social-messaging integration (Matrix, Discord, Telegram ..)

## Roadmap

- **v2.0** - mar/apr 2023 - ticketing, reviews, scheduling, website tweaks
- **v3.0** - may/jun 2023 - project submissions, federalized list of events + more
