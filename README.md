# confeth 🎉

**confeth** is a free and open-source conference/hackathon planning and managing tool with a focus on cryptocurrency-related events.

Its design is based on the popular planning tool [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/). We want to build a tool that is more compact, modern and minimalistic and contains most of the things needed to organize such an event. It is optimized for the cryptocurrency segment of open conferences and hackathons, such as those hosted by the [Ethereum community](https://ethereum.org/en/community/events/).

This project was created within the Czech-Slovak Ethereum community Gwei.cz for our own need to organize events such as [ETHBrno](http://ethbrno.cz/) hackathon or [UTXO Prague](https://utxo.cz/) conference. We will be happy if you use our tool or contribute!
